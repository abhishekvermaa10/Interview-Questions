<p style="text-align: left;">
    Answer to these questions is availabl in my YouTube shorts and Instagram reels. I am not sharing any answer here
    because goal is not to provide you questions and answers which you need to cram before interview, but to provide you
    idea that which question I have answered on which day. It will be always better to go through all questions at your
    own pace, understand my way of explaning and then create your own answer.
